# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, needed a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It, developed.  The game’s main function is to render stock images over a 30-second period for teams to guess what the picture is.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did well on the summary, constraints, and requirements documentation.  I also believe my explanation of the UML diagram was thorough.  I felt good about the evaluation section, though I also would have liked to flesh those areas out a bit more.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram and requirements were crucial to the code development phase of the project.  Without these tools, the development would have taken a lot longer and may not have been as concise as it should be.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to improve the evaluation and recommendations sections.  I was able to find a good number of resources to help me during my research, but I think these sections would benefit from more personal experiences as well.  Since I am still learning, I had to rely almost entirely on researching others’ experiences and opinions.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User’s needs are the backbone of any software design.  You could design a beautiful application, but if it does not meet the user’s needs, it is worthless.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Documenting the requirements, constraints, and UML diagram are practices I will take with me to implement in future projects.  Doing this work up front will save time and ensure accurate results.
